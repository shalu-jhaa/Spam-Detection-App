# Spam-Detection-App
This is a spam detection model that uses machine learning to classify emails as spam or ham. In this project, we have utilized a deep learning LSTM model to analyze text data and accurately classify emails. The model has been deployed as an interactive web app using Streamlit, where users can upload emails to get them classified as spam or ham.
